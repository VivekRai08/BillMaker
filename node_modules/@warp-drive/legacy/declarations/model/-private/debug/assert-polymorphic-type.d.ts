Assert that `addedRecord` has a valid type so it can be added to the
relationship of the `record`.

The assert basically checks if the `addedRecord` can be added to the
relationship (specified via `relationshipMeta`) of the `record`.

This utility should only be used internally, as both record parameters must
be stable record identifiers and the `relationshipMeta` needs to be the meta
information about the relationship, retrieved via
`record.relationshipFor(key)`.
