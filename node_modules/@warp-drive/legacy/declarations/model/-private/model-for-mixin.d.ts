In case someone defined a relationship to a mixin, for example:
```ts
class CommentModel extends Model {
@belongsTo('commentable', { polymorphic: true }) owner;
}

let Commentable = Mixin.create({
@hasMany('comment') comments;
});
```
we want to look up a Commentable class which has all the necessary
relationship meta data. Thus, we look up the mixin and create a mock
Model, so we can access the relationship CPs of the mixin (`comments`)
